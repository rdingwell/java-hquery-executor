 * This interface encapsulates the generic methods needed to temporarily associate a set of

 * The init method is invoked to create any temporary storage needed.
 * The emit method is invoked multiple times to associate a key with a single value.
 * NB: The same key can be associated with multiple values.
 * The iterator method is used to retrieve the keys.
 * The get method is used to lookup the values associated with each key.
 * The delete method is used to clean up any temporary storage.
